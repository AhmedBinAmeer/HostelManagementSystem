# 🏨 Hostel Management System (HMS)

### *A Modern, Automated Accommodation Portal for Air University*


## 📝 Introduction

The **Hostel Management System (HMS)** is a comprehensive digital solution developed to replace manual paper-based record-keeping in university hostels. Currently, there is no automated system in place at our university hostel; this project aims to fill that gap by providing a streamlined, secure, and transparent platform for both administrators (Wardens) and residents (Students).
